# Pi Services -

This code is being actively developed. Feel free to join with me but don't open issues by now, as i'm codding on it everyday. It's unstable and simple not ready yet.

Cech the dev branch.

A Hacklang framework for micro services development inspired by ServiceStack and many other PHP projects like Doctrine, Slim, Eqrs. Also C# FluentValidation
I'm doing this not only for learning purposes. I've a few small sites running with this code and i want to dedicate my programming efforts on this.

The main goal is to provide a simple framework for micro services development.
